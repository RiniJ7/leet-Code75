**Exercise 1**
**1768** Merge Strings Alternately**
You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.
Return the merged string.
Constraints:
1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 100
word1 and word2 consist of lowercase English letters.


**Exercise 2**
**1071** Greatest Common Divisor of Strings**
For two strings s and t, we say "t divides s" if and only if s = t + ... + t (i.e., t is concatenated with itself one or more times).
Given two strings str1 and str2, return the largest string x such that x divides both str1 and str2.
Constraints:
1 <= str1.length, str2.length <= 1000
str1 and str2 consist of English uppercase letters.
