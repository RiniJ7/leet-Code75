**Exercise 1**
**1768** Merge Strings Alternately**
You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.
Return the merged string.
Constraints:
1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 100
word1 and word2 consist of lowercase English letters.


**Exercise 2**
**1071** Greatest Common Divisor of Strings**
For two strings s and t, we say "t divides s" if and only if s = t + ... + t (i.e., t is concatenated with itself one or more times).
Given two strings str1 and str2, return the largest string x such that x divides both str1 and str2.
Constraints:
1 <= str1.length, str2.length <= 1000
str1 and str2 consist of English uppercase letters.

**Exercise 3**
**1431** Kids With the Greatest Number of Candies**
There are n kids with candies. You are given an integer array candies, where each candies[i] represents the number of candies the ith kid has, and an integer extraCandies, denoting the number of extra candies that you have.
Return a boolean array result of length n, where result[i] is true if, after giving the ith kid all the extraCandies, they will have the greatest number of candies among all the kids, or false otherwise.
Note that multiple kids can have the greatest number of candies.
Constraints:
n == candies.length
2 <= n <= 100
1 <= candies[i] <= 100
1 <= extraCandies <= 50
